## Overview

We call _features_ of Authorino the different things one can do to enforce identity verification & authentication and authorization on requests against protected services. These can be a specific identity verification method based on a supported authentication protocol, or a method to fetch additional auth metadata in request-time, etc.

Most features of Authorino relate to the different phases of the [Auth Pipeline](./architecture.md#the-auth-pipeline) and therefore are configured in the Authorino [`AuthConfig`](./architecture.md#the-authorino-authconfig-custom-resource-definition-crd). An _identity verification feature_ usually refers to a functionality of Authorino such as the [API key-based authentication](#api-key-identityapikey) implemented by Authorino, the [validation of JWTs/OIDC ID tokens](#openid-connect-oidc-jwtjose-verification-and-validation-identityoidc), and authentication based on [Kubernetes TokenReviews](#kubernetes-tokenreview-identitykubernetes). Analogously, [OPA](#open-policy-agent-opa-rego-policies-authorizationopa), [JSON pattern-matching](#json-pattern-matching-authorization-rules-authorizationjson) and [Kuberentes SubjectAccessReview](#kubernetes-subjectaccessreview-authorizationkubernetes) are examples of _authorization features_ of Authorino.

At a deeper level, a _feature_ can also be an additional funcionality within a bigger feature, usually applicable to the whole class the bigger feature belongs to. For instance, the configuration of the location and key selector of [auth credentials](#extra-auth-credentials-credentials), available for all identity verification-related features. Other examples would be [_Identity extension_](#extra-identity-extension-extendedproperties) and [_Response wrappers_](#extra-response-wrappers-wrapper-and-wrapperkey).

A full specification of all features of Authorino that can be configured in an `AuthConfig` can be found in the official [spec](../install/crd/authorino.kuadrant.io_authconfigs.yaml) of the custom resource definition.

You can also learn about Authorino features by using the [`kubectl explain`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#explain) command in a Kubernetes cluster where the Authorino CRD has been installed. E.g. `kubectl explain authconfigs.spec.identity.extendedProperties`.

## Common feature: JSON paths ([`valueFrom.authJSON`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#ValueFromAuthJSON))

The first feature of Authorino to learn about is a common functionality, used in the specification of many other features. _JSON paths_ have to do with reading data from the [Authorization JSON](./architecture.md#the-authorization-json), to refer to them in configuration of dynamic steps of API protection enforcing.

Usage examples of JSON paths are: dynamic URL and request parameters when fetching metadata from external sources, dynamic authorization policy rules, and dynamic authorization responses (injected JSON and Festival Wristband token claims).

### Syntax

The syntax to fetch data from the Authorization JSON with JSON paths is based on [GJSON](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tidwall/gjson). Refer to [GJSON Path Syntax](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md) page for more information.

### String modifiers

On top of GJSON, Authorino defines a few [string modifiers](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md#modifiers).

Examples below provided for the following Authorization JSON:

```jsonc
{
  "context": {
    "request": {
      "http": {
        "path": "/pets/123",
        "headers": {
          "authorization": "Basic amFuZTpzZWNyZXQK" // jane:secret
          "baggage": "eyJrZXkxIjoidmFsdWUxIn0=" // {"key1":"value1"}
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "auth": {
    "identity": {
      "username": "jane",
      "fullname": "Jane Smith",
      "email": "\u0006jane\u0012@petcorp.com\n"
    },
  },
}
```

**`@strip`**<br/>
Strips out any non printable characters such as carrige return. E.g. `auth.identity.email.@strip` → `"jane@petcorp.com"`.

**`@case:upper|lower`**<br/>
Changes the case of a string. E.g. `auth.identity.username.@case:upper` → `"JANE"`.

**`@replace:{"old":string,"new":string}`**<br/>
Replaces a substring within a string. E.g. `auth.identity.username.@replace:{"old":"Smith","new":"Doe"}` → `"Jane Doe"`.

**`@extract:{"sep":string,"pos":int}`**<br/>
Splits a string at occurrences of a separator (default: `" "`) and selects the substring at the `pos`-th position (default: `0`). E.g. `context.request.path.@extract:{"sep":"/","pos":2}` → `123`.

**`@base64:encode|decode`**<br/>
base64-encodes or decodes a string value. E.g. `auth.identity.username.decoded.@base64:encode` → `"amFuZQo="`.<br/>

In combination with `@extract`, `@base64` can be used to extract the username in an HTTP Basic Authentication request. E.g. `context.request.headers.authorization.@extract:{"pos":1}|@base64:decode|@extract:{"sep":":","pos":1}` → `"jane"`.

### Interpolation

_JSON paths_ can be interpolated into strings to build template-like dynamic values. E.g. `"Hello, {auth.identity.name}!"`.

## Identity verification & authentication features ([`identity`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Identity))

### API key ([`identity.apiKey`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Identity_APIKey))

Authorino relies on Kubernetes `Secret` resources to represent API keys.

To define an API key, create a `Secret` in the cluster containing an `api_key` entry that holds the value of the API key.

API key secrets must be created in the same namespace of the `AuthConfig` (default) or `spec.identity.apiKey.allNamespaces` must be set to `true` (only works with [cluster-wide Authorino instances](./architecture.md#cluster-wide-vs-namespaced-instances)).

API key secrets must be labeled with the labels that match the selectors specified in `spec.identity.apiKey.selector` in the `AuthConfig`.

Whenever an `AuthConfig` is indexed, Authorino will also index all matching API key secrets. In order for Authorino to also watch events related to API key secrets individually (e.g. new `Secret` created, updates, deletion/revocation), `Secret`s must also include a label that matches Authorino's bootstrap configuration `--secret-label-selector` (default: `authorino.kuadrant.io/managed-by=authorino`). This label may or may not be present to `spec.identity.apiKey.selector` in the `AuthConfig` without implications for the caching of the API keys when triggered by the reconciliation of the `AuthConfig`; however, if not present, individual changes related to the API key secret (i.e. without touching the `AuthConfig`) will be ignored by the reconciler.

**Example.** For the following `AuthConfig`:

```yaml
apiVersion: authorino.kuadrant.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: my-api-protection
  namespace: authorino-system
spec:
  hosts:
    - my-api.io
  identity:
    - name: api-key-users
      apiKey:
        selector:
          matchLabels: # the key-value set used to select the matching `Secret`s; resources including these labels will be acepted as valid API keys to authenticate to this service
            group: friends # some custom label
        allNamespaces: true # only works with cluster-wide Authorino instances; otherwise, create the API key secrets in the same namespace of the AuthConfig
```

The following Kubernetes `Secret` represents a valid API key:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: user-1-api-key-1
  namespace: default
  labels:
    authorino.kuadrant.io/managed-by: authorino # so the Authorino controller reconciles events related to this secret
    group: friends
stringData:
  api_key: <some-randomly-generated-api-key-value>
type: Opaque
```

The resolved identity object, added to the authorization JSON following an API key identity source evaluation, is the Kubernetes `Secret` resource (as JSON).

### Kubernetes TokenReview ([`identity.kubernetes`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Identity_KubernetesAuth))

Authorino can verify Kubernetes-valid access tokens (using Kubernetes [TokenReview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/authentication-resources/token-review-v1) API).

These tokens can be either `ServiceAccount` tokens such as the ones issued by kubelet as part of Kubernetes [Service Account Token Volume Projection](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#service-account-token-volume-projection), or any valid user access tokens issued to users of the Kubernetes server API.

The list of `audiences` of the token must include the requested host and port of the protected API (default), or all audiences specified in the Authorino `AuthConfig` custom resource. For example:

For the following `AuthConfig` CR, the Kubernetes token must include the audience `my-api.io`:

```yaml
apiVersion: authorino.kuadrant.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: my-api-protection
spec:
  hosts:
    - my-api.io
  identity:
    - name: cluster-users
      kubernetes: {}
```

Whereas for the following `AuthConfig` CR, the Kubernetes token audiences must include **foo** and **bar**:

```yaml
apiVersion: authorino.kuadrant.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: my-api-protection
spec:
  hosts:
    - my-api.io
  identity:
    - name: cluster-users
      kubernetes:
        audiences:
          - foo
          - bar
```

The resolved identity object added to the authorization JSON following a successful Kubernetes authentication identity evaluation is the `status` field of TokenReview response (see [TokenReviewStatus](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/authentication-resources/token-review-v1/#TokenReviewStatus) for reference).

### OpenID Connect (OIDC) JWT/JOSE verification and validation ([`identity.oidc`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Identity_OidcConfig))

In reconciliation-time, using [OpenID Connect Discovery well-known endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig), Authorino automatically discovers and caches OpenID Connect configurations and associated JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) for all OpenID Connect issuers declared in an `AuthConfig`. Then, in request-time, Authorino verifies the JSON Web Signature (JWS) and check the time validity of signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT) supplied on each request.

_Important!_ Authorino does **not** implement [OAuth2 grants](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4) nor [OIDC authentication flows](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Authentication). As a common recommendation of good practice, obtaining and refreshing access tokens is for clients to negotiate directly with the auth servers and token issuers. Authorino will only validate those tokens using the parameters provided by the trusted issuer authorities.

![OIDC](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/XO_1IWD138RlynIX9mLt7s1XfQANseDGnPx7sMmtE9EqcOpQjtUeWego7aF-__lubzcyMadHvMVYlLUV80bBc5GIWcb1v_eUDXY40qNoHiADKNtslRigDeaI2pINiBXRtLp3AkU2ke0EJkT0ESWBwj7zV3UryDNkO8inDckMLuPg6cddM0mXucWT11ycd9TjyF0X3AYM_v7TRjVtl_ckRTlFiOU2sVvU-PtpY4hZiU8U8DEElHN5cRIFD7Z3K_uCt_ONm4_ZkLiY3oN5Tm00)

The `kid` claim stated in the JWT header must match one of the keys cached by Authorino during OpenID Connect Discovery, therefore supporting JWK rotation.

The decoded payload of the validated JWT is appended to the authorization JSON as the resolved identity.

OpenID Connect configurations and linked JSON Web Ket Sets can be configured to be automatically refreshed (pull again from the OpenID Connect Discovery well-known endpoints), by setting the `identity.oidc.ttl` field (given in seconds, default: `0` – i.e. auto-refresh disabled).

For an excellent summary of the underlying concepts and standards that relate OpenID Connect and JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE), see this [article](https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/1976593) by Jan Rusnacko. For official specification and RFCs, see [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html), [OpenID Connect Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html), [JSON Web Token (JWT) (RFC7519)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519), and [JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)](http://www.iana.org/assignments/jose/jose.xhtml).

### OAuth 2.0 introspection ([`identity.oauth2`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Identity_OAuth2Config))

For bare OAuth 2.0 implementations, Authorino can perform token introspection on the access tokens supplied in the requests to protected APIs.

Authorino does not implement any of OAuth 2.0 grants for the applications to obtain the token. However, it can verify supplied tokens with the OAuth server, including opaque tokens, as long as the server exposes the `token_introspect` endpoint ([RFC 7662](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662)).

Developers must set the token introspection endpoint in the `AuthConfig`, as well as a reference to the Kubernetes secret storing the credentials of the OAuth client to be used by Authorino when requesting the introspect.

![OAuth 2.0 Token Introspect](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/NP1DJiD038NtSmehQuQgsr4R5TZ0gXLaHwHgD779g8aTF1xAZv0u3GVZ9BHH18YbttkodxzLKY-Q-ywaVQJ1Y--XP-BG2lS8AXcDkRSbN6HjMIAnWrjyp9ZK_4Xmz8lrQOI4yeHIW8CRKk4qO51GtYCPOaMG-D2gWytwhe9P_8rSLzLcDZ-VrtJ5f4XggvS17VXXw6Bm6fbcp_PmEDWTIs-pT4Y16sngccgyZY47b-W51HQJRqCNJ-k2O9FAcceQsomNsgBr8M1ATbJAoTdgyV2sZQJBHKueji5T96nAy-z5-vSAE7Y38gbNBDo8xGo-FZxXtQoGcYFVRm00)

The response returned by the OAuth2 server to the token introspection request is the the resolved identity appended to the authorization JSON.

### OpenShift OAuth (user-echo endpoint) (`identity.openshift`)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><small>Not implemented - In analysis</small></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Online token introspection of OpenShift-valid access tokens based on OpenShift's user-echo endpoint.

### Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) authentication (`identity.mtls`)

Authorino can verify x509 certificates presented by clients for authentication on the request to the protected APIs, at application level.

Trusted root Certificate Authorities (CA) are stored in Kubernetes Secrets labeled according to selectors specified in the AuthConfig, watched and indexed by Authorino. Make sure to create proper `kubernetes.io/tls`-typed Kubernetes Secrets, containing the public certificates of the CA stored in either a `tls.crt` or `ca.crt` entry inside the secret.

Truested root CA secrets must be created in the same namespace of the `AuthConfig` (default) or `spec.identity.mtls.allNamespaces` must be set to `true` (only works with [cluster-wide Authorino instances](./architecture.md#cluster-wide-vs-namespaced-instances)).

Client certificates must include x509 v3 extension specifying 'Client Authentication' extended key usage.

The identitiy object resolved out of a client x509 certificate is equal to the subject field of the certificate, and it serializes as JSON within the Authorization JSON usually as follows:

```jsonc
{
	"auth": {
		"identity": {
			"CommonName": "aisha",
			"Country": ["PK"],
			"ExtraNames": null,
			"Locality": ["Islamabad"],
			"Names": [
				{ "Type": [2, 5, 4, 3], "Value": "aisha" },
				{ "Type": [2, 5, 4, 6], "Value": "PK" },
				{ "Type": [2, 5, 4, 7], "Value": "Islamabad" },
				{ "Type": [2, 5, 4,10], "Value": "ACME Inc." },
				{ "Type": [2, 5, 4,11], "Value": "Engineering" }
			],
			"Organization": ["ACME Inc."],
			"OrganizationalUnit": ["Engineering"],
			"PostalCode": null,
			"Province": null,
			"SerialNumber": "",
			"StreetAddress": null
		}
  }
}
```

### Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) authentication (`identity.hmac`)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><small>Not implemented - Planned (<a href="https://github.com/kuadrant/authorino/issues/9">#9</a>)</small></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Authentication based on the validation of a hash code generated from the contextual information of the request to the protected API, concatenated with a secret known by the API consumer.

### Plain (`identity.plain`)

Authorino can read plain identity objects, based on authentication tokens provided and verified beforehand using other means (e.g. Envoy [JWT Authentication filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/jwt_authn_filter#config-http-filters-jwt-authn), Kubernetes API server authentication), and injected into the payload to the external authorization service.

The plain identity object is retrieved from the Authorization JSON based on a [JSON path](#common-feature-json-paths-valuefromauthjson) specified in the `AuthConfig`.

This feature is particularly useful in cases where authentication/identity verification is handled before invoking the authorization service and its resolved value injected in the payload can be trusted. Examples of applications for this feature include:
- Authentication handled in Envoy leveraging the Envoy JWT Authentication filter (decoded JWT injected as 'metadata_context')
- Use of Authorino as Kubernetes ValidatingWebhook service (Kubernetes 'userInfo' injected in the body of the `AdmissionReview` request)

Example of `AuthConfig` to retrieve plain identity object from the Authorization JSON.

```yaml
spec:
  identity:
  - name: plain
    plain:
      authJSON: context.metadata_context.filter_metadata.envoy\.filters\.http\.jwt_authn|verified_jwt
```

If the specified JSON path does not exist in the Authorization JSON or the value is `null`, the identity verification will fail and, unless other identity config succeeds, Authorino will halt the Auth Pipeline with the usual `401 Unauthorized`.

### Anonymous access (`identity.anonymous`)

Literally a no-op evaluator for the identity verification phase that returns a static identity object `{"anonymous":true}`.

It allows to implement `AuthConfigs` that bypasses the identity verification phase of Authorino, to such as:
- enable anonymous access to protected services (always or combined with [Priorities](#common-feature-priorities))
- postpone authentication in the Auth Pipeline to be resolved as part of an OPA policy

Example of `AuthConfig` spec that falls back to anonymous access when OIDC authentication fails, enforcing read-only access to the protected service in such cases:

```yaml
spec:
  identity:
  - name: jwt
    oidc: { endpoint: ... }
  - name: anonymous
    priority: 1 # expired oidc token, missing creds, etc default to anonymous access
    anonymous: {}
  authorization:
  - name: read-only-access-if-authn-fails
    when:
    - selector: auth.identity.anonymous
      operator: eq
      value: "true"
    json:
      rules:
      - selector: context.request.http.method
        operator: eq
        value: GET
```

### Festival Wristband authentication

Authorino-issued [Festival Wristband](#festival-wristband-tokens-responsewristband) tokens can be validated as any other signed JWT using Authorino's [OpenID Connect (OIDC) JWT/JOSE verification and validation](#openid-connect-oidc-jwtjose-verification-and-validation-identityoidc).

The value of the issuer must be the same issuer specified in the custom resource for the protected API originally issuing wristband. Eventually, this can be the same custom resource where the wristband is configured as a valid source of identity, but not necessarily.

### _Extra:_ Auth credentials ([`credentials`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Credentials))

All the identity verification methods supported by Authorino can be configured regarding the location where access tokens and credentials (i.e. authentication secrets) fly within the request.

By default, authentication secrets are expected to be supplied in the `Authorization` HTTP header, with the `Bearer` prefix and plain authentication secret, separated by space. The full list of supported options for the location of authentication secrets and selector is specified in the table below:

| Location (`credentials.in`) | Description                  | Selector (`credentials.keySelector`)             |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `authorization_header`      | `Authorization` HTTP header  | Prefix (default: `Bearer`)                       |
| `custom_header`             | Custom HTTP header           | Name of the header. Value should have no prefix. |
| `query`                     | Query string parameter       | Name of the parameter                            |
| `cookie`                    | Cookie header                | ID of the cookie entry                           |

### _Extra:_ Identity extension ([`extendedProperties`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Identity))

Resolved identity objects can be extended with user-defined JSON properties. Values can be static or fetched from the Authorization JSON.

A typical use-case for this feature is token normalization. Say you have more than one identity source listed in the your `AuthConfig` but each source issues an access token with a different JSON structure – e.g. two OIDC issuers that use different names for custom JWT claims of similar meaning; when two different identity verification/authentication methods are combined, such as API keys (whose identity objects are the corresponding Kubernetes `Secret`s) and Kubernetes tokens (whose identity objects are Kubernetes UserInfo data).

In such cases, identity extension can be used to normalize the token so it always includes the same set of JSON properties of interest, regardless of the source of identity that issued the original token verified by Authorino. This simplifies the writing of authorization policies and configuration of dynamic responses.

In case of extending an existing property of the identity object (replacing), the API allows to control whether to overwrite the value or not. This is particularly useful for normalizing tokens of a same identity source that nonetheless may occasionally differ in structure, such as in the case of JWT claims that sometimes may not be present but can be safely replaced with another (e.g. `username` or `sub`).

## External auth metadata features ([`metadata`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Metadata))

### HTTP GET/GET-by-POST ([`metadata.http`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Metadata_GenericHTTP))

Generic HTTP adapter that sends a request to an external service. It can be used to fetch external metadata for the authorization policies (phase ii of the Authorino [Auth Pipeline](./architecture.md#the-auth-pipeline)), or as a web hook.

The adapter allows issuing requests either by GET or POST methods; in both cases with URL and parameters defined by the user in the spec. Dynamic values fetched from the Authorization JSON can be used.

POST request parameters as well as the encoding of the content can be controlled using the `bodyParameters` and `contentType` fields of the config, respectively. The Content-Type of POST requests can be either `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (default) or `application/json`.

Authentication of Authorino with the external metadata server can be set either via long-lived shared secret stored in a Kubernetes Secret or via OAuth2 client credentials grant. For long-lived shared secret, set the `sharedSecretRef` field. For OAuth2 client credentials grant, use the `oauth2` option.

In both cases, the location where the secret (long-lived or OAuth2 access token) travels in the request performed to the external HTTP service can be specified in the [`credentials`](#extra-auth-credentials-credentials) field. By default, the authentication secret is supplied in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` prefix.

Custom headers can be set with the `headers` field. Nevertheless, headers such as `Content-Type` and `Authorization` (or eventual custom header used for carrying the authentication secret, set instead via the `credentials` option) will be superseded by the respective values defined for the fields `contentType` and `sharedSecretRef`.

### OIDC UserInfo ([`metadata.userInfo`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Metadata_UserInfo))

Online fetching of OpenID Connect (OIDC) UserInfo data (phase ii of the Authorino [Auth Pipeline](./architecture.md#the-auth-pipeline)), associated with an OIDC identity source configured and resolved in phase (i).

Apart from possibly complementing information of the JWT, fetching OpenID Connect UserInfo in request-time can be particularly useful for remote checking the state of the session, as opposed to only verifying the JWT/JWS offline.

Implementation requires an OpenID Connect issuer ([`spec.identity.oidc`](#openid-connect-oidc-jwtjose-verification-and-validation-identityoidc)) configured in the same `AuthConfig`.

The response returned by the OIDC server to the UserInfo request is appended (as JSON) to `auth.metadata` in the authorization JSON.

### User-Managed Access (UMA) resource registry ([`metadata.uma`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Metadata_UMA))

User-Managed Access (UMA) is an OAuth-based protocol for resource owners to allow other users to access their resources. Since the UMA-compliant server is expected to know about the resources, Authorino includes a client that fetches resource data from the server and adds that as metadata of the authorization payload.

This enables the implementation of resource-level Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) policies. Attributes of the resource fetched in a UMA flow can be, e.g., the owner of the resource, or any business-level attributes stored in the UMA-compliant server.

A UMA-compliant server is an external authorization server (e.g., Keycloak) where the protected resources are registered. It can be as well the upstream API itself, as long as it implements the UMA protocol, with initial authentication by `client_credentials` grant to exchange for a Protected API Token (PAT).

![UMA](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/ZOx1IWCn48RlUOgX9pri7w0GxOBYGGGj5G_Y8QHJTp2PgPE9qhStmhBW9NWSvll__ziM2ser9rS-Y4z1GuOiB75IoGYc5Ptp7dOOXICb2aR2Wr5xUk_6QfCeiS1m1QldXn4AwXVg2ZRmUzrGYTBki_lp71gzH1lwWYaDzopV357uIE-EnH0I7cq3CSG9dLklrxF9PyLY_rAOMNWSzts11dIBdYhg6HIBL8rOuEAwAlbJiEcoN_pQj9VOMtVZxdQ_BFHBTpC5Xs31RP4FDQSV)

It's important to notice that Authorino does NOT manage resources in the UMA-compliant server. As shown in the flow above, Authorino's UMA client is only to fetch data about the requested resources. Authorino exchanges client credentials for a Protected API Token (PAT), then queries for resources whose URI match the path of the HTTP request (as passed to Authorino by the Envoy proxy) and fetches data of each macthing resource.

The resources data is added as metadata of the authorization payload and passed as input for the configured authorization policies. All resources returned by the UMA-compliant server in the query by URI are passed along. They are available in the PDPs (authorization payload) as `input.auth.metadata.custom-name => Array`. (See [The "Auth Pipeline"](./architecture.md#the-auth-pipeline) for details.)

## Authorization features ([`authorization`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Authorization))

### JSON pattern-matching authorization rules ([`authorization.json`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Authorization_JSONPatternMatching))

Grant/deny access based on simple pattern-matching expressions ("rules") compared against values selected from the Authorization JSON.

Each expression is a tuple composed of:
- a `selector`, to fetch from the Authorization JSON – see [Common feature: JSON paths](#common-feature-json-paths-valuefromauthjson) for details about syntax;
- an `operator` – `eq` (_equals_), `neq` (_not equal_); `incl` (_includes_) and `excl` (_excludes_), for arrays; and `matches`, for regular expressions;
- a fixed comparable `value`

Rules can mix and combine literal expressions and references to expression sets ("named patterns") defined at the upper level of the `AuthConfig` spec. (See [Common feature: Conditions](#common-feature-conditions-when))

```yaml
spec:
  authorization:
    - name: my-simple-json-pattern-matching-policy
      json:
        rules: # All rules must match for access to be granted
          - selector: auth.identity.email_verified
            operator: eq
            value: "true"
          - patternRef: admin

  pattterns:
    admin: # a named pattern that can be reused in other sets of rules or conditions
      - selector: auth.identity.roles
        operator: incl
        value: admin
```

### Open Policy Agent (OPA) Rego policies ([`authorization.opa`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Authorization_OPA))

You can model authorization policies in [Rego language](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) and add them as part of the protection of your APIs.

Policies can be either declared in-line in Rego language (`inlineRego`) or as an HTTP endpoint where Authorino will fetch the source code of the policy in reconciliation-time (`externalRegistry`).

Policies pulled from external registries can be configured to be automatically refreshed (pulled again from the external registry), by setting the `authorization.opa.externalRegistry.ttl` field (given in seconds, default: `0` – i.e. auto-refresh disabled).

Authorino's built-in OPA module precompiles the policies during reconciliation of the AuthConfig and caches the precompiled policies for fast evaluation in runtime, where they receive the Authorization JSON as input.

![OPA](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/TP71IWD138RlynHXJmfklHTMMaKyMle6OPgwmKoopcQiHNntjqjTc8F79D__vm_PZ8xPIv8mlhCEc351ChNOPqi4dWk5CBMT8m-e3jlYlMLM0nm1_ueAQHuBYxUiyBhRDXVE1go9dGd7CsHwuz7p-G8jHGXT1tkAff65qTcqTKu4NHUMXT0-B09OmmrzEML5WM5sleLT4GaBqKxuegrTfcoJmNucAL_ruT9TXa-M1XQgPfMXcXC87NqD4MDF8QnMg-iT7uL6hm-eLx-Gmy5YIQGE9_OUM8VYTOJdJvI2_d-6YVc61aNirApdlzqVKKQwWoaA_8GDwQ4a-GK0)

An optional field `allValues: boolean` makes the values of all rules declared in the Rego document to be returned in the OPA output after policy evaluation. When disabled (default), only the boolean value `allow` is returned. Values of internal rules of the Rego document can be referenced in subsequent policies/phases of the Auth Pipeline.

### Kubernetes SubjectAccessReview ([`authorization.kubernetes`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Authorization_KubernetesAuthz))

Access control enforcement based on rules defined in the Kubernetes authorization system, i.e. `Role`, `ClusterRole`, `RoleBinding` and `ClusterRoleBinding` resources of Kubernetes RBAC.

Authorino issues a [SubjectAccessReview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/authorization-resources/subject-access-review-v1) (SAR) inquiry that checks with the underlying Kubernetes server whether the user can access a particular resource, resurce kind or generic URL.

It supports **resource attributes authorization check** (parameters defined in the `AuthConfig`) and **non-resource attributes authorization check** (HTTP endpoint inferred from the original request).
- Resource attributes: adequate for permissions set at namespace level, defined in terms of common attributes of operations on Kubernetes resources (namespace, API group, kind, name, subresource, verb)
- Non-resource attributes: adequate for permissions set at cluster scope, defined for protected endpoints of a generic HTTP API (URL path + verb)

Example of Kubernetes role for resource attributes authorization:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pet-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: ["pets.io"]
  resources: ["pets"]
  verbs: ["get"]
```

Example of Kubernetes cluster role for non-resource attributes authorization:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: pet-editor
rules:
- nonResourceURLs: ["/pets/*"]
  verbs: ["put", "delete"]
```

Kubernetes authorization policy configs look like the following in an Authorino `AuthConfig`:

```yaml
authorization:
  - name: kubernetes-rbac
    kubernetes:
      user:
        valueFrom: # values of the parameter can be fixed (`value`) or fetched from the Auhtorization JSON (`valueFrom.authJSON`)
          authJSON: auth.identity.metadata.annotations.userid

      groups: [] # user groups to test for.

      # for resource attributes permission checks; omit it to perform a non-resource attributes SubjectAccessReview with path and method/verb assumed from the original request
      # if included, use the resource attributes, where the values for each parameter can be fixed (`value`) or fetched from the Auhtorization JSON (`valueFrom.authJSON`)
      resourceAttributes:
        namespace:
          value: default
        group:
          value: pets.io # the api group of the protected resource to be checked for permissions for the user
        resource:
          value: pets # the resource kind
        name:
          valueFrom: { authJSON: context.request.http.path.@extract:{"sep":"/","pos":2} } # resource name – e.g., the {id} in `/pets/{id}`
        verb:
          valueFrom: { authJSON: context.request.http.method.@case:lower } # api operation – e.g., copying from the context to use the same http method of the request
```

`user` and properties of `resourceAttributes` can be defined from fixed values or patterns of the Authorization JSON.

An array of `groups` (optional) can as well be set. When defined, it will be used in the `SubjectAccessReview` request.

### Authzed/SpiceDB ([`authorization.authzed`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Authorization_Authzed))

Check permission requests sent to a Google Zanzibar-based [Authzed/SpiceDB](https://authzed.com) instance, via gRPC.

Subject, resource and permission parameters can be set to static values or read from the Authorization JSON.

```yaml
spec:
  authorization:
  - name: authzed
    authzed:
      endpoint: spicedb:50051
      insecure: true # disables TLS
      sharedSecretRef:
        name: spicedb
        key: token
      subject:
        kind:
          value: blog/user
        name:
          valueFrom:
            authJSON: auth.identity.sub
      resource:
        kind:
          value: blog/post
        name:
          valueFrom:
            authJSON: context.request.http.path.@extract:{"sep":"/","pos":2} # /posts/{id}
      permission:
        valueFrom:
          authJSON: context.request.http.method
```

### Keycloak Authorization Services (UMA-compliant Authorization API)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><small>Not implemented - In analysis</small></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Online delegation of authorization to a Keycloak server.

## Dynamic response features ([`response`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Response))

### JSON injection ([`response.json`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Response_DynamicJSON))

User-defined dynamic JSON objects generated by Authorino in the response phase, from static or dynamic data of the auth pipeline, and passed back to the external authorization client within added HTTP headers or as Envoy [Well Known Dynamic Metadata](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/advanced/well_known_dynamic_metadata).

The following Authorino `AuthConfig` custom resource is an example that defines 3 dynamic JSON response items, where two items are returned to the client, stringified, in added HTTP headers, and the third is wrapped as Envoy Dynamic Metadata("emitted", in Envoy terminology). Envoy proxy can be configured to "pipe" dynamic metadata emitted by one filter into another filter – for example, from external authorization to rate limit.

```yaml
apiVersion: authorino.kuadrant.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
  name: my-api-protection
spec:
  hosts:
    - my-api.io
  identity:
    - name: edge
      apiKey:
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            authorino.kuadrant.io/managed-by: authorino
      credentials:
        in: authorization_header
        keySelector: APIKEY
  response:
    - name: a-json-returned-in-a-header
      wrapper: httpHeader # can be omitted
      wrapperKey: x-my-custom-header # if omitted, name of the header defaults to the name of the config ("a-json-returned-in-a-header")
      json:
        properties:
          - name: prop1
            value: value1
          - name: prop2
            valueFrom:
              authJSON: some.path.within.auth.json

    - name: another-json-returned-in-a-header
      wrapperKey: x-ext-auth-other-json
      json:
        properties:
          - name: propX
            value: valueX

    - name: a-json-returned-as-envoy-metadata
      wrapper: envoyDynamicMetadata
      wrapperKey: auth-data
      json:
        properties:
          - name: api-key-ns
            valueFrom:
              authJSON: auth.identity.metadata.namespace
          - name: api-key-name
            valueFrom:
              authJSON: auth.identity.metadata.name
```

### Plain ([`response.plain`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Response_Plain))

Simpler, yet more generalized form, for extending the authorization response for header mutation and Envoy Dynamic Metadata, based on plain text values.

The value can be static:

```yaml
response:
- name: x-auth-service
  plain:
    value: Authorino
```

or fetched dynamically from the [Authorization JSON](./architecture.md#the-authorization-json) (which includes support for [interpolation](#interpolation)):

```yaml
- name: x-username
  plain:
    valueFrom:
      authJSON: auth.identity.username
```

### Festival Wristband tokens ([`response.wristband`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Response_Wristband))

Festival Wristbands are signed OpenID Connect JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) issued by Authorino at the end of the auth pipeline and passed back to the client, typically in added HTTP response header. It is an opt-in feature that can be used to implement Edge Authentication Architecture (EAA) and enable token normalization. Authorino wristbands include minimal standard JWT claims such as `iss`, `iat`, and `exp`, and optional user-defined custom claims, whose values can be static or dynamically fetched from the authorization JSON.

The Authorino `AuthConfig` custom resource below sets an API protection that issues a wristband after a successful authentication via API key. Apart from standard JWT claims, the wristband contains 2 custom claims: a static value `aud=internal` and a dynamic value `born` that fetches from the authorization JSON the date/time of creation of the secret that represents the API key used to authenticate.

```yaml
apiVersion: authorino.kuadrant.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
  name: my-api-protection
spec:
  hosts:
    - my-api.io
  identity:
    - name: edge
      apiKey:
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            authorino.kuadrant.io/managed-by: authorino
      credentials:
        in: authorization_header
        keySelector: APIKEY
  response:
    - name: my-wristband
      wristband:
        issuer: https://authorino-oidc.default.svc:8083/my-namespace/my-api-protection/my-wristband
        customClaims:
          - name: aud
            value: internal
          - name: born
            valueFrom:
              authJSON: auth.identity.metadata.creationTimestamp
        tokenDuration: 300
        signingKeyRefs:
          - name: my-signing-key
            algorithm: ES256
          - name: my-old-signing-key
            algorithm: RS256
      wrapper: httpHeader # can be omitted
      wrapperKey: x-ext-auth-wristband # whatever http header name desired - defaults to the name of  the response config ("my-wristband")
```

The signing key names listed in `signingKeyRefs` must match the names of Kubernetes `Secret` resources created in the same namespace, where each secret contains a `key.pem` entry that holds the value of the private key that will be used to sign the wristbands issued, formatted as [PEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail). The first key in this list will be used to sign the wristbands, while the others are kept to support key rotation.

For each protected API configured for the Festival Wristband issuing, Authorino exposes the following OpenID Connect Discovery well-known endpoints (available for requests within the cluster):
- **OpenID Connect configuration:**<br/>
  https://authorino-oidc.default.svc:8083/{namespace}/{api-protection-name}/{response-config-name}/.well-known/openid-configuration
- **JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) well-known endpoint:**<br/>
  https://authorino-oidc.default.svc:8083/{namespace}/{api-protection-name}/{response-config-name}/.well-known/openid-connect/certs

### _Extra:_ Response wrappers ([`wrapper`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Response_Wrapper) and [`wrapperKey`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#Response_Wrapper))

#### Added HTTP headers

By default, Authorino dynamic responses (injected JSON and Festival Wristband tokens) are passed back to Envoy, stringified, as injected HTTP headers. This can be made explicit by setting the `wrapper` property of the response config to `httpHeader`.

The property `wrapperKey` controls the name of the HTTP header, with default to the name of dynamic response config when omitted.

#### Envoy Dynamic Metadata

Authorino dynamic responses (injected JSON and Festival Wristband tokens) can be passed back to Envoy in the form of Envoy Dynamic Metadata. To do so, set the `wrapper` property of the response config to `envoyDynamicMetadata`.

A response config with `wrapper=envoyDynamicMetadata` and `wrapperKey=auth-data` in the `AuthConfig` can be configured in the Envoy route or virtual host setting to be passed to rate limiting filter as below. The metadata content is expected to be a dynamic JSON injected by Authorino containing `{ "auth-data": { "api-key-ns": string, "api-key-name": string } }`. (See the response config `a-json-returned-as-envoy-metadata` in the example for the [JSON injection feature](#json-injection-responsejson) above)

```yaml
# Envoy config snippet to inject `user_namespace` and `username` rate limit descriptors from metadata returned by Authorino
rate_limits:
- actions:
    - metadata:
        metadata_key:
          key: "envoy.filters.http.ext_authz"
          path:
          - key: auth-data
          - key: api-key-ns
        descriptor_key: user_namespace
    - metadata:
        metadata_key:
          key: "envoy.filters.http.ext_authz"
          path:
          - key: auth-data
          - key: api-key-name
        descriptor_key: username
```

### _Extra:_ Custom denial status ([`denyWith`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kuadrant/authorino/api/v1beta1?utm_source=gopls#DenyWith))

By default, Authorino will inform Envoy to respond with `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` respectively when the identity verification (phase i of the [Auth Pipeline](./architecture.md#the-auth-pipeline)) or authorization (phase ii) fail. These can be customized by specifying `spec.denyWith` in the `AuthConfig`.

## Callbacks (`callbacks`)

### HTTP endpoints (`callbacks.http`)

Sends requests to specified HTTP endpoints at the end of the auth pipeline.

The scheme of the `http` field is the same as of [`metadata.http`](#http-getget-by-post-metadatahttp).

Example:

```yaml
spec:
  identity: […]
  authorization: […]

  callbacks:
    - name: log
      http:
        endpoint: http://logsys
        method: POST
        body:
          valueFrom:
            authJSON: |
              \{"requestId":context.request.http.id,"username":"{auth.identity.username}","authorizationResult":{auth.authorization}\}
    - name: important-forbidden
      when:
        - selector: auth.authorization.important-policy
          operator: eq
          value: "false"
      http:
        endpoint: "http://monitoring/important?forbidden-user={auth.identity.username}"
```

## Common feature: Priorities

_Priorities_ allow to set sequence of execution for blocks of concurrent evaluators within phases of the [Auth Pipeline](./architecture.md#the-auth-pipeline-aka-enforcing-protection-in-request-time).

Evaluators of same priority execute concurrently to each other "in a block". After syncing that block (i.e. after all evaluators of the block have returned), the next block of evaluator configs of consecutive priority is triggered.

Use cases for priorities are:
1. Saving expensive tasks to be triggered when there's a high chance of returning immediately after finishing executing a less expensive one – e.g.
    - an identity config that calls an external IdP to verify a token that is rarely used, compared to verifying JWTs preferred by most users of the service;
    - an authorization policy that performs some quick checks first, such as verifying allowed paths, and only if it passes, moves to the evaluation of a more expensive policy.
2. Establishing dependencies between evaluators - e.g.
    - an external metadata request that needs to wait until a previous metadata responds first (in order to use data from the response)

Priorities can be set using the `priority` property available in all evaluator configs of all phases of the Auth Pipeline (identity, metadata, authorization and response). The lower the number, the highest the priority. By default, all evaluators have priority 0 (i.e. highest priority).

Consider the following example to understand how priorities work:

```yaml
apiVersion: authorino.kuadrant.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: talker-api-protection
spec:
  hosts:
    - talker-api
  identity:
    - name: tier-1
      priority: 0
      apiKey:
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            tier: "1"
    - name: tier-2
      priority: 1
      apiKey:
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            tier: "2"
    - name: tier-3
      priority: 1
      apiKey:
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            tier: "3"
  metadata:
    - name: first
      http:
        endpoint: http://talker-api:3000
        method: GET
    - name: second
      priority: 1
      http:
        endpoint: http://talker-api:3000/first_uuid={auth.metadata.first.uuid}
        method: GET
  authorization:
    - name: allowed-endpoints
      when:
        - selector: context.request.http.path
          operator: neq
          value: /hi
        - selector: context.request.http.path
          operator: neq
          value: /hello
        - selector: context.request.http.path
          operator: neq
          value: /aloha
        - selector: context.request.http.path
          operator: neq
          value: /ciao
      json:
        rules:
          - selector: deny
            operator: eq
            value: "true"
    - name: more-expensive-policy # no point in evaluating this one if it's not an allowed endpoint
      priority: 1
      opa:
        inlineRego: |
          allow { true }
  response:
    - name: x-auth-data
      json:
        properties:
          - name: tier
            valueFrom:
              authJSON: auth.identity.metadata.labels.tier
          - name: first-uuid
            valueFrom:
              authJSON: auth.metadata.first.uuid
          - name: second-uuid
            valueFrom:
              authJSON: auth.metadata.second.uuid
          - name: second-path
            valueFrom:
              authJSON: auth.metadata.second.path
```

For the `AuthConfig` above,

- Identity configs `tier-2` and `tier-3` (priority 1) will only trigger (concurrently) in case `tier-1` (priority 0) fails to validate the authentication token first. (This behavior happens without perjudice of context canceling between concurrent evaluators – i.e. evaluators that _are_ triggered concurrently to another, such as `tier-2` and `tier-3`, continue to cancel the context of each other if any of them succeeds validating the token first.)

- Metadata source `second` (priority 1) uses the response of the request issued by metadata source `first` (priority 0), so it will wait for `first` to finish by triggering only in the second block.

- Authorization policy `allowed-endpoints` (piority 0) is considered to be a lot less expensive than `more-expensive-policy` (priority 1) and has a high chance of denying access to the protected service (if the path is not one of the allowed endpoints). By setting different priorities to these policies we ensure the more expensive policy if triggered in sequence of the less expensive one, instead of concurrently.

## Common feature: Conditions (`when`)

_Conditions_, named `when` in the AUthCOnfig API, are sets of expressions (JSON patterns) that, whenever included, must evaluate to true against the [Authorization JSON](./architecture.md#the-authorization-json), so the scope where the expressions are defined is enforced. If any of the expressions in the set of conditions for a given scope does not match, Authorino will skip that scope in the [Auth Pipeline](./architecture.md#the-auth-pipeline).

The scope for a set of `when` conditions can be the entire `AuthConfig` ("top-level conditions") or a particular evaluator of any phase of the auth pipeline.

Each expression is a tuple composed of:
- a `selector`, to fetch from the Authorization JSON – see [Common feature: JSON paths](#common-feature-json-paths-valuefromauthjson) for details about syntax;
- an `operator` – `eq` (_equals_), `neq` (_not equal_); `incl` (_includes_) and `excl` (_excludes_), for arrays; and `matches`, for regular expressions;
- a fixed comparable `value`

Literal expressions and references to expression sets (`patterns`, defined at the upper level of the `AuthConfig` spec) can be listed, mixed and combined in `when` conditions sets.

_Conditions_ can be used, e.g.,:

i) to skip an entire `AuthConfig` based on the context:

```yaml
spec:
  when: # no authn/authz required on requests to /status
  - selector: context.request.http.path
    operator: neq
    value: /status
```

ii) to skip parts of an `AuthConfig` (i.e. a specific evaluator):

```yaml
spec:
  metadata:
  - name: metadata-source
    http:
      endpoint: https://my-metadata-source.io
    when: # only fetch the external metadata if the context is HTTP method different than OPTIONS
    - selector: context.request.http.method
      operator: neq
      value: OPTIONS
```

iii) to enforce a particular evaluator only in certain contexts (really the same as the above, though to a different use case):

```yaml
spec:
  identity:
  - name: authn-meth-1
    apiKey: {...} # this authn method only valid for POST requests to /foo[/*]
    when:
    - selector: context.request.http.path
      operator: matches
      value: ^/foo(/.*)?$
    - selector: context.request.http.method
      operator: eq
      value: POST

  - name: authn-meth-2
    oidc: {...}
```

iv) to avoid repetition while defining patterns for conditions:

```yaml
spec:
  patterns:
    a-pet: # a named pattern that can be reused in sets of conditions
    - selector: context.request.http.path
      operator: matches
      value: ^/pets/\d+(/.*)$

  metadata:
  - name: pets-info
    when:
    - patternRef: a-pet
    http:
      endpoint: https://pets-info.io?petId={context.request.http.path.@extract:{"sep":"/","pos":2}}

  authorization:
  - name: pets-owners-only
    when:
    - patternRef: a-pet
    opa:
      inlineRego: |
        allow { input.metadata["pets-info"].ownerid == input.auth.identity.userid }
```

v) mixing and combining literal expressions and refs:

```yaml
spec:
  patterns:
    foo:
    - selector: context.request.http.path
      operator: eq
      value: /foo

  when: # unauthenticated access to /foo always granted
  - patternRef: foo
  - selector: context.request.http.headers.authorization
    operator: eq
    value: ""

  authorization:
  - name: my-policy-1
    when: # authenticated access to /foo controlled by policy
    - patternRef: foo
    json: {...}
```

vi) to avoid evaluating unnecessary identity checks when the user can indicate the preferred authentication method (again the pattern of skipping based upon the context):

```yaml
spec:
  identity:
  - name: jwt
    when:
    - selector: selector: context.request.http.headers.authorization
      operator: matches
      value: JWT .+
    oidc: {...}

  - name: api-key
    when:
    - selector: context.request.http.headers.authorization
      operator: matches
      value: APIKEY .+
    apiKey: {...}
```

## Common feature: Caching (`cache`)

Objects resolved at runtime in an [Auth Pipeline](./architecture.md#the-auth-pipeline-aka-enforcing-protection-in-request-time) can be cached "in-memory", and avoided being evaluated again at a subsequent request, until it expires. A lookup cache key and a TTL can be set individually for any evaluator config in an AuthConfig.

Each cache config induces a completely independent cache table (or "cache namespace"). Consequently, different evaluator configs can use the same cache key and there will be no colision between entries from different evaluators.

E.g.:

```yaml
spec:
  hosts:
  - my-api.io

  identity: [...]

  metadata:
  - name: external-metadata
    http:
      endpoint: http://my-external-source?search={context.request.http.path}
    cache:
      key:
        valueFrom: { authJSON: context.request.http.path }
      ttl: 300

  authorization:
  - name: complex-policy
    opa:
      externalRegistry:
        endpoint: http://my-policy-registry
    cache:
      key:
        valueFrom:
          authJSON: "{auth.identity.group}-{context.request.http.method}-{context.request.http.path}"
      ttl: 60
```

The example above sets caching for the 'external-metadata' metadata config and for the 'complex-policy' authorization policy. In the case of 'external-metadata', the cache key is the path of the original HTTP request being authorized by Authorino (fetched dynamically from the [Authorization JSON](./architecture.md#the-authorization-json)); i.e., after obtaining a metadata object from the external source for a given contextual HTTP path one first time, whenever that same HTTP path repeats in a subsequent request, Authorino will use the cached object instead of sending a request again to the external source of metadata. After 5 minutes (300 seconds), the cache entry will expire and Authorino will fetch again from the source if requested.

As for the 'complex-policy' authorization policy, the cache key is a string composed the 'group' the identity belongs to, the methodd of the HTTP request and the path of the HTTP request. Whenever these repeat, Authorino will use the result of the policy that was evaluated and cached priorly. Cache entries in this namespace expire after 60 seconds.

**Notes on evaluator caching**

_Capacity_ - By default, each cache namespace is limited to 1 mb. Entries will be evicted following First-In-First-Out (FIFO) policy to release space. The individual capacity of cache namespaces is set at the level of the Authorino instance (via `--evaluator-cache-size` command-line flag or `spec.evaluatorCacheSize` field of the `Authorino` CR).

_Usage_ - Avoid caching objects whose evaluation is considered to be relatively cheap. Examples of operations associated to Authorino auth features that are usually NOT worth caching: validation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Kubernetes TokenReviews and SubjectAccessReviews, API key validation, simple JSON pattern-matching authorization rules, simple OPA policies. Examples of operations where caching may be desired: OAuth2 token introspection, fetching of metadata from external sources (via HTTP request), complex OPA policies.

## Common feature: Metrics (`metrics`)

By default, Authorino will only export metrics down to the level of the AuthConfig. Deeper metrics at the level of each evaluator within an AuthConfig can be activated by setting the common field `metrics: true` of the evaluator config.

E.g.:

```yaml
apiVersion: authorino.kuadrant.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: my-authconfig
  namespame: my-ns
spec:
  metadata:
  - name: my-external-metadata
    http:
      endpoint: http://my-external-source?search={context.request.http.path}
    metrics: true
```

The above will enable the metrics `auth_server_evaluator_duration_seconds` (histogram) and `auth_server_evaluator_total` (counter) with labels `namespace="my-ns"`, `authconfig="my-authconfig"`, `evaluator_type="METADATA_GENERIC_HTTP"` and `evaluator_name="my-external-metadata"`.

The same pattern works for other types of evaluators. Find below the list of all types and corresponding label constant used in the metric:

| Evaluator type             | Metric's `evaluator_type` label |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `identity.apiKey`          | IDENTITY_APIKEY                 |
| `identity.kubernetes`      | IDENTITY_KUBERNETES             |
| `identity.oidc`            | IDENTITY_OIDC                   |
| `identity.oauth2`          | IDENTITY_OAUTH2                 |
| `identity.mtls`            | IDENTITY_MTLS                   |
| `identity.hmac`            | IDENTITY_HMAC                   |
| `identity.plain`           | IDENTITY_PLAIN                  |
| `identity.anonymous`       | IDENTITY_NOOP                   |
| `metadata.http`            | METADATA_GENERIC_HTTP           |
| `metadata.userInfo`        | METADATA_USERINFO               |
| `metadata.uma`             | METADATA_UMA                    |
| `authorization.json`       | AUTHORIZATION_JSON              |
| `authorization.opa`        | AUTHORIZATION_OPA               |
| `authorization.kubernetes` | AUTHORIZATION_KUBERNETES        |
| `response.json`            | RESPONSE_JSON                   |
| `response.wristband`       | RESPONSE_WRISTBAND              |

Metrics at the level of the evaluators can also be enforced to an entire Authorino instance, by setting the <code>--deep-metrics-enabled</code> command-line flag. In this case, regardless of the value of the field `spec.(identity|metadata|authorization|response).metrics` in the AuthConfigs, individual metrics for all evaluators of all AuthConfigs will be exported.
